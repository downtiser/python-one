The following is my python notes:

import getpass pa=getpass.getpass('password') #tips: this statement can only be exhibited through terminal in Pycharm rather than through Run#

import sys
sys.path
sys.argv  #input some arguments to made a list, if no input, there is still a path in the list
print(sys.argv[2])

import os
os.system('shell order')  #execute the shell order
res=os.popen('shell order').read()  #assign the shell order result to the variable 'res' tips: Don't forget "**.read()**"
print(res)

os.mkdir('new directory name')   #create a new directory in your present directory#
